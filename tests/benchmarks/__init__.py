"""
Benchmarking suite for pghatch API performance testing.

This module provides comprehensive benchmarking for the pghatch FastAPI application,
focusing on key performance metrics including:

- Response Time: Time for API to receive request and send response
- Throughput: Number of requests handled per time unit
- Error Rate: Percentage of requests resulting in errors
- Latency: Delay between request and first byte of response (TTFB)
- Resource Utilization: CPU and memory usage metrics
- Success Rate: Percentage of successful responses
- API Consumption: Requests per minute/second metrics
- Concurrency: Ability to handle multiple simultaneous requests
- Data Transfer Speed: Speed of data transfer between client and server
- SDK Performance: Client-side library performance metrics
