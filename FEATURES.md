Let me analyze the pgrestcue project and identify useful features based on different user personas. First, let me understand the current state of the project better.

From what I can see, pgrestcue appears to be a PostgreSQL REST API generator that automatically creates REST endpoints based on database introspection. It has table and procedure resolvers, suggesting it can expose database tables and functions/procedures as REST APIs.

## User Personas

__1. Frontend Developer (Sarah)__

- Needs quick access to database data for web/mobile apps
- Wants simple REST endpoints without writing backend code
- Values good API documentation and predictable response formats
- Needs filtering, sorting, and pagination capabilities

__2. Data Analyst (Mike)__

- Wants to access database data for reporting and analytics
- Needs to call stored procedures and functions for complex queries
- Values CSV/JSON export capabilities
- Needs authentication and access control

__3. DevOps Engineer (Alex)__

- Responsible for deploying and maintaining the API
- Needs monitoring, logging, and performance metrics
- Values containerization and easy deployment
- Needs security features and rate limiting

__4. Database Administrator (Lisa)__

- Wants to control which tables/functions are exposed
- Needs fine-grained access control and audit logging
- Values schema validation and data integrity
- Needs to monitor database performance impact

## Useful Features to Implement

### Core API Features

1. __Advanced Filtering & Querying__

   - Query parameters for WHERE clauses (`?name=eq.John`, `?age=gt.25`)
   - Full-text search capabilities
   - JSON path queries for JSONB columns
   - Aggregation endpoints (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.)

2. __Pagination & Sorting__

   - Cursor-based pagination for large datasets
   - Multiple sorting criteria
   - Configurable page size limits

3. __Data Modification__

   - CRUD operations with proper HTTP methods
   - Bulk operations (batch inserts/updates)
   - Upsert capabilities
   - Transaction support

### Security & Access Control

4. __Authentication & Authorization__

   - JWT token support
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Row-level security integration
   - API key management

5. __Schema Control__

   - Whitelist/blacklist tables and functions
   - Column-level permissions
   - Custom endpoint naming
   - Schema versioning

### Developer Experience

6. __API Documentation__

   - Auto-generated OpenAPI/Swagger docs
   - Interactive API explorer
   - Code generation for client SDKs
   - Postman collection export

7. __Response Formats__

   - Multiple output formats (JSON, CSV, XML)
   - Custom response transformations
   - Nested resource embedding
   - Field selection (`?select=name,email`)

### Operations & Monitoring

8. __Performance & Caching__

   - Query result caching (Redis integration)
   - Connection pooling optimization
   - Query performance monitoring
   - Rate limiting and throttling

9. __Observability__

   - Structured logging with correlation IDs
   - Metrics collection (Prometheus integration)
   - Health check endpoints
   - Database query analytics

### Advanced Features

10. __Real-time Capabilities__

    - WebSocket support for live data
    - PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY integration
    - Server-sent events for data changes

11. __Integration Features__

    - Webhook support for data changes
    - Event sourcing capabilities
    - Message queue integration
    - External API proxying

## Implementation Approaches

### 1. Configuration-Driven Approach

- YAML/JSON configuration files for API behavior
- Runtime configuration updates
- Environment-specific settings
- Schema-based auto-configuration

### 2. Annotation-Based Approach

- Database comments as API metadata
- Custom PostgreSQL extensions for API hints
- Function/table annotations for behavior control

### 3. Plugin Architecture

- Middleware system for request/response processing
- Custom resolver plugins
- Authentication provider plugins
- Output format plugins

### 4. Code Generation Approach

- Generate static API code from schema
- Build-time optimization
- Type-safe client generation
- Custom template support
